Production Cost Analysis:

This MATLAB project calculates the quarterly and yearly production costs for a manufacturing company, considering material, labor, and transportation costs. The data is provided through two matrices: ProdCost (representing cost per product) and ProdQuartProduction (quarterly production quantities).

What the Code Does:

Computes the total cost for each product by summing material, labor, and transportation expenses.
Calculates quarterly costs for each category (material, labor, transportation).
Summarizes yearly costs based on the four quarters.
Outputs detailed costs for each quarter and an overall yearly production cost.

Features:

Breakdown of costs by material, labor, and transportation.
Quarterly and yearly cost summaries.
Easily adaptable for different production datasets.

How to Run:
