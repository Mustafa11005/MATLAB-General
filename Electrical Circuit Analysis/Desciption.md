Electrical Circuit Analysis

This MATLAB project calculates current intensity and power in an electrical circuit for various resistances and voltages. It uses the formulas:

Current (I): I = V / R 

Power (P): P = (V ^ 2) / R
 
What the Code Does:

Computes current intensity for given resistances and voltages.
Calculates power dissipation for each voltage-resistance pair.

Features:

Easily adaptable for different values of resistances and voltages.
Simple and efficient code structure for circuit analysis.
